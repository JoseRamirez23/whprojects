        <h3>How To Play The Game</h3>
        <p>To play this game, the player has to read the text  and determine whether you think it's safe behind the door or it's a trap.
            To pick the door you want, you need to click on the up arrow button which is located on the bottom of the door. Once you have die an alert will 
            pop up on your screen that saying, "You Messed Up." And if you somehow beat the game a congratulation alert will pop up.
            Now shall we begin.
